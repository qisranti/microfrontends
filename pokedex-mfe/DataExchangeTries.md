# Data Exchange Tries

Here we are going to see all the different ways that I tried to communicate components from other remotes.

## Pokelib State-Service (Failed)

I tried to use a shared service with the next content:

```ts
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class PokedexStateService {
  // #pokemonId = new BehaviorSubject<number>(1);
  #pokemonId = signal<number>(1);

  get pokemonId() {
    // return this.#pokemonId.asObservable();
    return this.#pokemonId.asReadonly();
  }

  setPokemonId(id: number): void {
    // this.#pokemonId.next(id);
    this.#pokemonId.set(id);
  }
}
```

I have configured the federation.config of each project with the next shared section:

* Shell
```ts
shared: {
    ...shareAll({ singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' }),
    '@angular/core/rxjs-interop': {
      singleton: true,
      strictVersion: true,
      requiredVersion: 'auto',
    },
    '@angular/material': { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
    '@angular/cdk': { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
    pokelib: { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
  },
```
* Remote 1
```ts
shared: {
    ...shareAll({ singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' }),
    pokelib: { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
  },
```
* Remote 2
```ts
shared: {
    ...shareAll({ singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' }),
    pokelib: { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
  },
```

This is the way I'm using it to set the value in pokemons.component.ts
```ts
  selectPokemon(pokemonUrl: string) {
    const pokemonId = this.#pokemonIdPipe.transform(pokemonUrl);
    this.#selectedPokemonId.set(Number(pokemonId));
    this.#pokedexState.setPokemonId(pokemonId);
    console.log('Selected ID in Pokemons List Component:', this.#selectedPokemonId());
  }
```
Also the way I'm rendering the remote component pokedex it's the next:
```ts
async loadPokemonDetails(): Promise<void> {
    try {
      const m = await loadRemoteModule({
        remoteEntry: 'http://localhost:4202/remoteEntry.json',
        exposedModule: './Pokedex',
      });

      const componentRef = this.placePokemonDetails.createComponent(m.PokedexComponent, {
        injector: this.#injector,
      });
      runInInjectionContext(this.#injector, () => {
        effect(() => {
          const currentId = this.#pokedexState.pokemonId();
          componentRef.setInput('pokemonId', currentId);
        });
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed loading the Pokemon Details:', error);
    }
  }
```
this it's being logged without any issues and it seems to be working but when I go to the child component and try to get the information from the service it retrieves only the default value and not the realtime changes, this is how I'm getting the info from the service:
```ts
  readonly pokemonId = computed(() => this.#pokedexState.pokemonId());
  ngOnInit(): void {
    const currentId = this.#pokedexState.pokemonId();
    console.log('Current Pokemon ID:', currentId);
  }
```

## Router Outlet (Not Applicable)

First thing to do it's to add the configuration in app.routes.ts:
```ts
  {
    path: 'pokedex/:pokemonId',
    loadComponent: () =>
      loadRemoteModule('remote2', './Pokedex')
        .then((m) => m.PokedexComponent)
        .catch((err) => {
          console.error('Error loading pokedex', err);
          return null;
        }),
  },
```
then I have to also define in the routes of the remote2 the routing for that project:
```ts
export const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: PokedexComponent,
  }
];
```
also to be able to use the pokemonId we have to do the next:
```ts
readonly #route = inject(ActivatedRoute);
constructor() {
  this.#route.paramMap.subscribe(params => {
    const id = params.get('pokemonId');
    console.log('ID del pokemon seleccionado:', id);
  });
}
```
Even that this approach will work it's not what I need right now as I want a floating window in the MFE component

## Input (Current Approach)

To achieve the objective of dynamically communicate from one component to another I used the next approach:

1. First I create the component dynamically with the properties that I need to pass to the child component.
```ts
const m = await loadRemoteModule({
        remoteEntry: 'http://localhost:4202/remoteEntry.json',
        exposedModule: './Pokedex',
      });
```
2. To handle the communication and execute in the same context than the host I use runInInjectionContext
```ts
const componentRef = this.placePokemonDetails.createComponent(m.PokedexComponent, {
        injector: this.#injector,
      });
      runInInjectionContext(this.#injector, () => {
        effect(() => {
          const currentId = this.#pokedexState.pokemonId();
          componentRef.setInput('pokemonId', currentId);
        });
      });
```
3. As we can see in the previous piece of code there is an effect that it's being used to detect changes
4. This gets the actual value of pokemonId
```ts
const currentId = this.#pokedexState.pokemonId();
```
5. Every time that the pokemonId changes this line it's going to update the input of the component
```ts
componentRef.setInput('pokemonId', currentId);
```

## Conclusion
The actual approach it's the right way to do it as this ensures that the Pokedex Component it's an standalone component and can be utilized in any part of the project.
